<title>JOELVIN AS A MILLONARE</title>
 <h1> IF I WAS RICH (did not know what to write about all of this is a lie) </h1>
<p> The only place where I am rich is the Dominican Republic but If I was rich in the USA it would be a luxury. Big Houses Finest Clothing and Best Jewelry. It would look amazing. Don't get me wrong I still look amazing and I will look just as amazing rich. A mirror saves my life. My hobby is into looking in a mirror. Some people aren't met to be rich and fortunately, I am meant to be rich. Money is just my thing and that's that. If you're not meant for it that's you but on the other hand, I was made for it. </p>
